# Personal Dotfiles

This repo contains all my personal dotfile configurations for a cool, modified Ubuntu computer using all the nifty tools that enhance development productivity.

- Compton for transparency in windows
- Termite as a terminal emulator
- Polybar for awesome system information bar
- GTK-3.0 for system styling
- GTK Theme: KISSKOOL-SIZZLING-RED
- Tmux as a terminal multiplexer
- Vim as editor of choice
- Oh-My-ZSH as a replacement to bash shell
